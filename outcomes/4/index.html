        <h1>Outcome #4</h1>
        <h4>Decision Making & Production</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;In high school, most writing followed the same cut-and-dry formula. Start with a thesis, write three paragraphs expounding on it, and conclude by restating what you’ve already written. This class has ripped up that formula, and recycled its pieces into a number of new, more interesting prompts that often come with constraints. My writing that resulted from these prompts exemplifies Outcome #4 by adapting to the more creative of the prompts with notable changes in writing style.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Near the end of the first half of the semester, we were assigned to “write a scene” describing a specific experience we had with writing. Whereas other assignments had focused on analysis or summary, this one was explicitly based on developing a narrative.  Before writing the narrative, we were instructed to brainstorm by answering questions that could help to flesh out important details. This brainstorming directly led to the inclusion of certain sentences and ideas in the final product, like the name of my teacher and the comments about the discomfort I experienced while writing. The most apparent distinction between this piece of writing, when compared to other assignments I wrote this semester, is the tone. It’s much more casual, bordering on sarcastic at times, almost as if I was in conversation with the reader. By adjusting my linguistic choices (such as the use of repetition in “... that morning. Or that afternoon. Or that evening,” and “words led into phrases into finished texts”), or the general structure I followed (ending without a conclusive statement, instead saying “Oh well.”), I was able to cultivate a different experience for the reader, conveying the feelings I had felt during the experiences depicted by the narrative.
