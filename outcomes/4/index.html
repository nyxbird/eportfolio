        <h4>Decision Making & Production</h4>

            &emsp;&emsp;In high school, most writing followed the same cut-and-dry formula. Start with a thesis, write three paragraphs expounding on it, and conclude by restating what you’ve already written. This class has ripped up that formula, and recycled its pieces into a number of new, more interesting prompts that often come with constraints. My writing that resulted from these prompts exemplifies Outcome #4 by adapting to the more creative of the prompts with notable changes in writing style.

                <h3>Showing Vs. Telling</h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;I had been thinking for a while. Thinking about ways to rework every part of my art, and thinking about ways to start the writing that would be due in about an hour. It wasn’t a lot of writing, thankfully. It just wouldn’t be feasible to have those AP graders read tens of thousands of full-length while grading our portfolios of artwork. I had asked my AP 2D-Art teacher, Mrs. Garrity, for help in re-wording the little writing I had completed, and her help, as it usually did, came mostly in the form of encouragement and a reassurance that what I was doing was great as-is. With most other teachers, I wouldn’t take this genuinely, and would have read it more as a cop-out than a genuine evaluation of my work. With her, though, it was hard to take any sort of cynical view. Despite her rather short stature, her personality was anything but small. She had an infectious joy that could shake you out of any art block, and an optimistic outlook on life. It was with her encouragement that I was able to complete my portfolio up to that point, which ended up earning a 5 out of 5, as I would learn during the following summer.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Even with her encouragement, I didn’t get much more done that morning. Or that afternoon. Or that evening. Procrastination has always been a struggle of mine, and the other projects that were due, when combined with the general hubbub of AP season, only worsened my tendencies. So that night, I set out to write, mostly from scratch, all the text necessary for my portfolio. Sitting in my bed for hours while constantly bending forward to type on the noisy keyboard of a school-assigned Chromebook wouldn’t be a pleasant experience, but it was necessary. Once I focused on writing, though, any distractions and annoyances began to fade away. My typing became rhythmic, as words led into phrases into finished texts. The back pain remained, unfortunately, but it waned in intensity, at least. Once the writing was done, all that was left was to compress my texts into the absurdly short, College Board-enforced 600-character limit. It wasn’t bad initially, although the switch from writing to deleting pulled me out of my focused trance, but toward the end of the process, I felt like I was grasping for straws as I deleted spaces after punctuation, and abbreviated what few words I could. Miraculously, the whole exercise ended successfully, even if what writing was left would give any grammar nut nightmares.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I wish that I could say the experience taught me something, perhaps that procrastination isn’t a valid strategy when it comes to important projects. In all honesty, though, I’d say that it’s done the opposite. I still procrastinate, and now do so with the knowledge that I can in fact get away with it. Oh well.

            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Near the end of the first half of the semester, we were assigned to “write a scene” describing a specific experience we had with writing. Whereas other assignments had focused on analysis or summary, this one was explicitly based on developing a narrative.  Before writing the narrative, we were instructed to brainstorm by answering questions that could help to flesh out important details. This brainstorming directly led to the inclusion of certain sentences and ideas in the final product, like the name of my teacher and the comments about the discomfort I experienced while writing. The most apparent distinction between this piece of writing, when compared to other assignments I wrote this semester, is the tone. It’s much more casual, bordering on sarcastic at times, almost as if I was in conversation with the reader. By adjusting my linguistic choices (such as the use of repetition in “... that morning. Or that afternoon. Or that evening,” and “words led into phrases into finished texts”), or the general structure I followed (ending without a conclusive statement, instead saying “Oh well.”), I was able to cultivate a different experience for the reader, conveying the feelings I had felt during the experiences depicted by the narrative.
