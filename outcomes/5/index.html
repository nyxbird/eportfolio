            &emsp;&emsp;Module III dealt with the concepts of literacies, multimodality, and intertextuality. At the center of these lies the idea of “multiliteracies”, understandings of multiple mediums and how they interact with one another. The module also contained readings that focused on multiliteracies, and the relationship between them and power. After reading these,  we were told to both reflect on the texts we had read, and discuss multiliteracies of our own.

                <h3>Multiliteracies</h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;I was 5 years old the first time I walked in a game store. To me, the building seemed vast, with its shelves filled with board games of unfamiliar titles, and its walls lined with posters advertising the newest sets of card games. I (alongside my mother) had come to buy Pokémon cards, but the two of us ended up walking out the store with an additional purchase: a board game. We had played board games before, of course, but they were those of the standard fare (think Monopoly, Life, or Trivial Pursuit). This game, however, was more niche. It was aimed more toward TTRPG players, being set in the same universe as D&D, but didn’t use the storytelling aspects that TTRPGs are known for.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The two of us continued to (and occasionally still do) visit that store, adding games to our somewhat excessive collection. Each purchase is a piece that fits into a large map of games. While games don’t rely on others in the same way that Dale Jacob’s comics did, the mechanics of each can be traced back to other games before them, and the strategies that work in one can be generalized to others with similar mechanical roots. In a way, this consistency of concepts and strategies forms an “intertext” of games, even if it’s much subtler than that of other mediums.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The store, among many others, was a major sponsor in my literacy of board games. It held events occasionally, acting as a forum for the discussion, playing, and exchanging of games. It also allowed visitors to play games from a select collection of games, even without the intent to purchase them. Both of these, alongside the urge to try out something new, kept my mother and I coming back to the store, each time increasing our literacy of tabletop games.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Outside of the store, we mainly played two-player games, with just the two of us. Once or twice a year, though, various board game conventions would be held, giving us the opportunity to both play with others, and explore games we wouldn’t otherwise be able to try. These conventions were like supercharged versions of the store’s events, facilitating ‘discussions’ on a scale the size of a convention hall as opposed to a corner store.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Neither of these groups held much power over us. While the events were nice, they weren’t the only place to play games, with game stores being littered all around our city, and conventions and events (albeit smaller ones) occurring at various times throughout the year. The individual game publishers, too, didn’t have much sway in our life. Hundreds of publishers produce popular games, and our existing collection is large enough to sustain a small store of its own. Still though, we find ourselves returning to the conventions year after year, and the store at least once every few months.

            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Here, I examine my literacy of board games, pointing to the “web” of strategies and concepts that appear within them often as an example of their intertextuality, and conventions and stores as discourse communities. I also speak about my personal history with board games as a medium, and how a game store became my primary literacy sponsor. At the end, I explain how the idea of “power” ties into my literacy, and how the many avenues through which I can obtain and play games prevents a specific group from holding a large amount of power over me.
