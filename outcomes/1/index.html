            &emsp;&emsp;Our second major project asked us to examine our history with writing by identifying habits, patterns, or areas for improvement. I chose to focus on my struggles with procrastination, and described two specific examples of my past writing experiences in order to both concretely portray my history and reflect on the less abstract results of my habits.

                &emsp;&emsp;So, if I can’t eliminate my serial procrastination, can I at least limit the consequences of it? I’ve had a mixed experience with trying to do this. In some cases, my postponement isn’t apparent in the work I produce, and in others, it results in an obvious downgrade in quality. Two assignments that I think display this dichotomy well are my submissions to two AP exams, AP 2-D Art and AP Capstone Seminar.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The AP 2-D Art exam, unsurprisingly, consists mainly of a student’s 2-D art. Students have to create about 10 pieces throughout the year, and compile them into a portfolio alongside both text describing each piece’s meaning, and paragraph-length responses that explain how the portfolio develops a specific inquiry. The night before the portfolio was due, I stayed up to complete the writing portion. I had considered the inquiry when creating the pieces, but having to weave a thread through the more disparate pieces while maintaining a small character count was a difficult task, only worsened by the combination of the very imminent deadline and my uncomfortable writing position. Being propped up from behind by pillows while leaning into a laptop while sitting on a deforming mattress would make anyone’s back hurt. However, all of these factors added a pressure to the situation that forced me to write faster, and my need for a perfect response helped right any sub-par sections of my writing. In the end, I was able to submit the portfolio just in time, and earned a 5 out of 5 on the exam.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;AP Seminar, on the other hand, didn’t go as smoothly. The class requires the submission of two main writing projects: Performance Tasks 1 and 2. Performance Task 1 is completed in a group setting, with group members choosing a common topic, and each writing a paper about an aspect of it. A group presentation is completed alongside it, with members synthesizing a solution or an examination of their topic from its constituent’s pieces. Performance Task 2, though, is performed completely individually, with students choosing a topic based on a provided set of sources, and both writing a 2000-word paper and presenting their findings. The topic is broad (my year’s was “courage”), but still restricts the focus of the paper heavily.

            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Throughout module II, we were prompted to look back on our past writings and the conditions that surrounded them. When doing this, and when brainstorming for the module’s major project, I reflected on my issues with procrastinating, and how I’ve tried to fix them, to no avail. I was also able to discuss how I’ve adapted to them, and can often manage to write well under tight deadlines.
