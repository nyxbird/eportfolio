        <h4>Multiple Literacies & Goal Setting</h4>

        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;When writing about a book or passage, the only literacy truly necessary is that of text. Depending on the topic, a literacy in that may be helpful, but as long as one can understand the reading, they should be able to draw at least a basic analysis. While most high school classes stuck solely to these text-based resources, this class required us to develop other, visual, literacies during the first module, which asked us to analyze and compare products. I chose to analyze trading card packs, contrasting their styling and content, and seeing what tone they set.

                        <td>The pack shows the game’s name at the top of its image, the set’s name near the bottom, and the booster type (Play Booster) under that. In the upper-left corner, in small text, is the number of cards contained in the pack (14). The game name is in the logo’s typeface, while the set name is in all-caps in a free-flowing and whimsical font.</td>
                        <td>The pack’s text only really emphasizes the name of the game, and the set name. The name of the set, Bloomburrow, when combined with the font, helps to paint the set as calm and fantastical.</td>

                        <td>What <b>colors</b> are used on the pack? How are they arranged?</td>

                        <td>The pack’s background, which extends both above and below its image, is sky-blue. The foreground of the image is warm, consisting of browns and reds, while the area under it is a grass-green. The game’s name is in white on the blue background, and the logo next to it is a bright red. The set name, which lies on the grass, is white with a green glow around it.</td>

                        <td>The pack depicts a bipedal mouse, Mabel, looking intently slightly to the side of the pack, while holding a shield and flaming sword, which cuts off the edge of the pack. She stands against a clear sky on grass, and wears a deep red coat and flowers. In the story, she acts as a leader to the main characters’ party.</td>
                        <td>For those who have read the story, Mabel acts as a representation of the story’s adventuring party. For those who haven’t, the image of a mouse on a serene scene holding a flaming sword summarizes the setting very succinctly. The mouse shows that the setting consists of animals, the background the setting’s general mood, and the sword the presence of a conflict, both thematically and during gameplay.</td>

            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Here, I ask three questions about the pack’s appearance, examining its text, colors, and imagery, and three questions that analyze those three features. While text is nothing new, analyzing colors and imagery requires developing a visual literacy, practicing a skill that I found myself using very little in classes before this one. The Module I major project takes this further, applying these questions, alongside others, to two more card packs, and comparing how the responses to them differ.
