            &emsp;&emsp;Our first major essay for this class was an analysis of multiple texts that were similar in purpose, but differed in execution. In my case, I picked three packs of trading cards from different brands, and analyzed how each appealed to a different audience and reflected varying philosophies behind their creation.

                <h3>Project I (excerpt)</h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;Somewhat sadly, neither I nor my mother have any sort of recollection of how we discovered that first game. What led us to buy that first pack? What did we see in it that other products didn’t offer? Why Pokémon, and not Yu-Gi-Oh? In the case of trading card games, most potential new buyers will only have a single point of reference: the packs. Each publisher designs their card packs with the intent to reel in new customers, and continue to profit from old ones. So, how do publishers design this intent into their packs? How do they appeal to their specific audiences, while standing out from each other? In this essay, I’ll show how various trading card games appeal to their intended audiences through the appearance of their packs.
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In order to answer these questions, it’s important to define important pieces of terminology. In this case, the brands are rhetors, the creators of individual ‘texts’ (the packs). The reason for the text’s existence is referred to as its exigence. Here, the exigence is the need to both attract new customers and maintain existing ones, in order to generate profits. These customers are the text’s audience, the target of its messaging. The way in which the message is conveyed, the card packs, acts as a constraint on each rhetor’s ability to communicate to their respective audience, shaping the nature of the text. These four pieces (that is, the rhetor, exigence, audience, and constraints) form a rhetorical situation. In the case of competing rhetors, academic Keith Grant-Davie argues that it is more helpful to analyze the multiple rhetorical situations as one, stating, “It may be useful, then, to think of an entire discussion as a compound rhetorical situation, made up of a group of closely related individual situations” (274). By analyzing the texts altogether, we can compare the way different rhetors seek out different audiences despite similar exigences and constraints. 
                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;To examine the texts, I’ll focus on the most apparent qualities of various TCG card packs, or the parts that a consumer will see first: colors, art, and text. Colors are the first piece of information a shopper will receive, and they primarily create an aesthetic, rather than present any information to the viewer. The art present on a pack can intrigue new customers, further drawing them in, or communicate to enfranchised buyers by using familiar imagery. Text, which is likely to be absorbed last, can both communicate practical information, like the contents and brand, and express a certain aesthetic, through both naming and font.

            <br>&emsp;&emsp;While writing, I described and picked apart each of my chosen texts, breaking them down into individual components that each built up an “image” of the brand and game being presented, and contrasted corresponding parts in order to determine how they present themselves in different ways.
