            This site contains my ENC 1101 ePortfolio, consisting of a letter to the professor, 6 outcome reflections, and the 3 major projects I worked on this year. You can access all of these from the navigation bar at the top of the page.

            As for me, I'm currently a high school senior dual-enrolling in this course. I spend a lot of time writing code, so I decided to write the HTML and CSS for this site from scratch! (I like purple, if that's not obvious.)
