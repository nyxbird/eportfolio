        <h1>Confessions of a Procrastinator (1513 words)</h1>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Sitting down to write an essay, for me, often isn’t truly a test of ability. I’m fairly confident in my skills as a writer; even if I’m not the best writer, I’m usually able to meet requirements and churn out something worthy of a decent grade. What it does test, though, are my drive and focus, which are often lacking in strength. Whenever a writing assignment appears, it usually sits in the back of my mind, nagging me until I feel the need to complete it. Unfortunately, that feeling tends to show up on or after the due date. My constant procrastination isn’t just an issue for writing, but the amount of time and creativity that essays tend to require worsens the problem.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;In my younger years, my mother’s guidance and strict adherence to deadlines helped to suppress any of my procrastinating tendencies. Assignments would have to be done as soon as they possibly could, and large projects should be done about a week before their due date. As I grew more independent, though, these rules flew out the window. That week of time between the completion of a project and me turning it in shrunk to a day during middle school, and to an hour in high school. Whenever I was presented with a task, I would put it off, dismissing it as boring and time-wasting, and would refocus my efforts on something more interesting, albeit less necessary. This had the benefit of letting me work on personal projects and learn more about topics I enjoy, at the cost of assignments often being turned in late, if at all. My grades tended not to heavily suffer, as my performance on in-class assignments that I couldn’t procrastinate on, like tests and quizzes, was generally high, but I’ve had a number of close calls where I’ve had to talk to teachers in order to prevent the loss of too many points on a crucial assignment. And yet, even with all of the obvious downsides, I find myself unable to kick my habit.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;This isn’t for lack of trying. Over all of those years of procrastination, my mother and I have done a number of things to try and break the pattern. We’ve tried to remove distractions by restricting me from them, only for me to spend more time trying to circumvent said restriction than doing the assignment at hand. I’ve tried to reward myself for completing a task quickly, only to prefer whatever other activity I’d rather be doing to receiving the reward. My classmates have also tried to nudge me to finish faster, but their words aren’t enough to change my behavior. Why is this such a struggle for me? What’s holding me back that my peers can so easily bypass?
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;When I was in first grade, every student took a gifted test, which, combined with reports about a student’s behavior and performance, would allow a spot in a gifted program. Said gifted program kept track of each student’s performance throughout their academic career, with parents receiving an written evaluation of their child each year. The annual reports, rather than analyzing students’ grades or test-taking abilities, were more behavioral. While all other aspects of the program were left behind in elementary, I continue to receive these reports at the end of each year. While they praise me for performing well academically, the reports always point out my distractibility and lack of focus. Earlier reports also mention these, referring to my experience as executive dysfunction, a common symptom of ADHD and autism. I haven’t undergone any formal testing, but based on personal research (when I should have been doing assignments) and the opinions of my peers with these disorders, me having one of these isn’t exactly far-fetched.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The constant access to the internet doesn’t help either. Most of my assignments are done digitally at this point, with only the occasional worksheet being given. While doing writing assignments is made easier by the presence of a text editor, the ability to open a new tab and step into a world of distractions only makes it easier to break my focus. Even in the more interesting assignments, the allure of the internet is enough to shake me out of a productive mood. Completing assignments on paper helps with this to an extent, but I’m often still bored enough to completely disregard the assignment and switch to some other activity, either digital or physical.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;So, if I can’t eliminate my serial procrastination, can I at least limit the consequences of it? I’ve had a mixed experience with trying to do this. In some cases, my postponement isn’t apparent in the work I produce, and in others, it results in an obvious downgrade in quality. Two assignments that I think display this dichotomy well are my submissions to two AP exams, AP 2-D Art and AP Capstone Seminar.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The AP 2-D Art exam, unsurprisingly, consists mainly of a student’s 2-D art. Students have to create about 10 pieces throughout the year, and compile them into a portfolio alongside both text describing each piece’s meaning, and paragraph-length responses that explain how the portfolio develops a specific inquiry. The night before the portfolio was due, I stayed up to complete the writing portion. I had considered the inquiry when creating the pieces, but having to weave a thread through the more disparate pieces while maintaining a small character count was a difficult task, only worsened by the combination of the very imminent deadline and my uncomfortable writing position. Being propped up from behind by pillows while leaning into a laptop while sitting on a deforming mattress would make anyone’s back hurt. However, all of these factors added a pressure to the situation that forced me to write faster, and my need for a perfect response helped right any sub-par sections of my writing. In the end, I was able to submit the portfolio just in time, and earned a 5 out of 5 on the exam.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;AP Seminar, on the other hand, didn’t go as smoothly. The class requires the submission of two main writing projects: Performance Tasks 1 and 2. Performance Task 1 is completed in a group setting, with group members choosing a common topic, and each writing a paper about an aspect of it. A group presentation is completed alongside it, with members synthesizing a solution or an examination of their topic from its constituent’s pieces. Performance Task 2, though, is performed completely individually, with students choosing a topic based on a provided set of sources, and both writing a 2000-word paper and presenting their findings. The topic is broad (my year’s was “courage”), but still restricts the focus of the paper heavily.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;All of this is to say that AP Seminar provided a fairly heavy workload. My class’s teacher, who had already wasted the first semester with projects that, in hindsight, were fairly useless, left midway through the second semester, losing us both a primary motivator and helper in the writing process. In similar classes, the daily reminders of a teacher and the ability to ask them questions was integral when attempting to write in an unfamiliar format. The length of the papers and the need to perform one’s own research was new to our class, and the lack of an educator was apparent in the results. These factors ended up leading to my procrastination having a visible effect on my final work.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Usually, I’m able to pull from past experiences when writing, and rely on structures or concepts I’ve used before. By doing this, I’m able to speed up the writing process to the point where I’m comfortable putting off assignments similar to those I’ve completed before. When presented with something new, though, doing this is much more difficult, as I now have to conform the bits and pieces that I’d normally put together into a new format, and I lack intuition about what sort of techniques work successfully. In AP Seminar, my responses to both Performance Tasks 1 and 2 were lacking in length, depth, and quality. Of course, the absence of a teacher’s feedback didn’t help, but the root of the issue was my willingness to delay the assignment more and more, until it was too late to create anything but a flimsy attempt at a paper.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;So, as I write this essay the night that it’s due, can I truly say that I’ve learned from my experiences? Have I now solved my issues? Am I doomed to keep repeating this cycle? I’m not sure. My experience with procrastination is complicated, and as seen in the varying results of my pushed-back work, it’s one that I’m not really proud of, especially when it’s led to failures. But that feeling of completing something just in time, of wording something perfectly while working against a clock, is one that just isn’t matched by writing under schedules and planning. Some of my most enjoyable and memorable moments when writing come from being able to accomplish these feats, and those, without a doubt, I am proud of.
