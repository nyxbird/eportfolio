        <h1>The World Wide What? (953 words)</h1>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The internet, both for me and many others, is a second world. At this point in time, it’s almost a necessity in daily life, and the separation between our physical and digital lives only grows thinner as time passes. The creation and normalization of internet-enabled smartphones and devices has undoubtedly shifted the ways in which we interact with the world. By the time I was born, though, this process was well underway. To me, the presence of the internet was never a shift, but a truth. It’s been there since my younger days (even if it was less influential), and I’m not sure how my life would look without it.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Trying to wrap up the internet into a single concept, or to discuss it as a whole, is futile. It’s a broad and vast universe of its own, and even sites that are a single click apart will often have vastly different cultures and lexicons. There’s common patterns and ideas, sure, but there’s also differences tenfold, both minor and major. The trends of TikTok and Tumblr will fly over the heads of Facebook users, and the lingo of 4chan dwellers will be incomprehensible to just about anyone else. Even customs taken for granted, like the usage of all-caps to indicate volume, remain unknown to some (often older) users, even after years. Still though, even if there are no true universals, understanding those common patterns is an important skill due to the internet’s omnipresence. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The first time I remember being taught about internet etiquette (or “netiquette”, as they, and nobody else, called it) was 4th grade. My school had a “computer” class that we would go to once or twice a week, being placed on a rotating schedule with P.E. and music. The content wasn’t very interesting, in all honesty. Most of the class was learning touch typing (which I’ve learned to appreciate as I’ve grown), or being warned about the hidden dangers of the internet (most of which were obvious, even to an elementary schooler). An excessive amount of time was spent on reminders not to share one’s name, location, age, or other sensitive information. The etiquette lessons re-iterated this, but added spice in the form of rules meant to facilitate communication, rather than prevent it. These boiled down to simple statements that aren’t all that specific to the internet, like “be polite” and “don’t pry”, and they seemed like a blip in a sea of other boring information I was taught at school. And it was! I think that there was a lot of emphasis placed on treating the internet as an innately hostile and dangerous place, rather than acknowledging that it is, in many aspects, not that different from the real world. Both have the potential for wonderful and horrible things, and with their interconnectedness, problems in one often follow you to the other. They do, however, have one very crucial difference.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Anonymity isn’t an invention of the internet, but it’s not really a stretch to say that nowhere else does it exist in such large quantities. With the rise of video-based social media platforms, it’s less common, but it’s undeniable how easy it is to remain anonymous online. This is both the source and protection from the dangers I was taught as a child: it can obscure the identity and nature of bad actors, but it can also shield their targets from true harm. More than any other skill, learning how to use anonymity and not be harmed by it is a prerequisite for any sort of internet literacy. No matter what lexicon or medium a platform takes, there will always be trolls and others who seek to worsen others’ experience, whether it be through scams, bigotry, or plain annoyance. The ability to deal with them, whether it’s through de-escalation, blocking, or just ignoring them, is a tool that should be in any netizen’s belt.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Outside of the more negative aspects, most of my personal internet literacy comes from personal experience. It’s somewhat funny how the ways in which I’ve spoken online have “degraded” in grammatical quality as I’ve adapted to the internet’s linguistic landscape. Text-based forms of internet literacy aren’t difficult to pick up, but becoming comfortable with balancing being casual and impersonal, and acting “naturally” on the internet is something that can only really be gained from experience.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;There’s a very apparent shift in how I (and again, many others) used the internet before and after quarantine. Before the pandemic, the internet was an important part of life, but it wasn’t unfeasible to live life fairly offline. During the pandemic, though, it became the medium through which school, work, and communication had to occur. Even after the pandemic has (mostly) ended, the internet’s position as an all-in-one replacement for face-to-face interaction has remained. After all, if one could work, order groceries, or learn from the comfort of their own house, why wouldn’t they? Once frameworks were set in place, the internet’s omnipresence became cemented in our lives.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The quarantine forced many, including me, to work on their internet literacy. With the ability to chat with friends in-person gone, I turned to social media and forums to get my socialization fix. Spending time in various chatrooms, whether they be hosted on Discord, Reddit, or independent sites, showed me a side of the internet that my elementary school classes hadn’t. Keeping up with rapidly-cycling trends, which often took the form of images and videos, and parsing unfamiliar abbreviations and slang became a masterclass in piecing together multimodal context clues. I learned how to balance the aforementioned anonymity with snippets of my personality and story, and how to read between the lines when trying to interpret another’s mood or tone.
