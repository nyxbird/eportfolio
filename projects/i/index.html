            &emsp;&emsp;I’ve played card games for the majority of my life. I have a number of fond childhood memories of building Pokémon decks and playing with others in game stores and at school. As I grew up, my interest in card games branched out into other games, both physical and digital. Those games drove, and continue to drive, my non-gaming interests. The video games I played nudged me toward programming, which I’ve grown to love over many years, as a hobby and a potential career. In this aspect, it’s not much of a stretch to say that games, especially those first few card games, have inspired and guided me heavily throughout my lifetime.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Somewhat sadly, neither I nor my mother have any sort of recollection of how we discovered that first game. What led us to buy that first pack? What did we see in it that other products didn’t offer? Why Pokémon, and not Yu-Gi-Oh? In the case of trading card games, most potential new buyers will only have a single point of reference: the packs. Each publisher designs their card packs with the intent to reel in new customers, and continue to profit from old ones. So, how do publishers design this intent into their packs? How do they appeal to their specific audiences, while standing out from each other? In this essay, I’ll show how various trading card games appeal to their intended audiences through the appearance of their packs.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In order to answer these questions, it’s important to define important pieces of terminology. In this case, the brands are rhetors, the creators of individual ‘texts’ (the packs). The reason for the text’s existence is referred to as its exigence. Here, the exigence is the need to both attract new customers and maintain existing ones, in order to generate profits. These customers are the text’s audience, the target of its messaging. The way in which the message is conveyed, the card packs, acts as a constraint on each rhetor’s ability to communicate to their respective audience, shaping the nature of the text. These four pieces (that is, the rhetor, exigence, audience, and constraints) form a rhetorical situation. In the case of competing rhetors, academic Keith Grant-Davie argues that it is more helpful to analyze the multiple rhetorical situations as one, stating, “It may be useful, then, to think of an entire discussion as a compound rhetorical situation, made up of a group of closely related individual situations” (274). By analyzing the texts altogether, we can compare the way different rhetors seek out different audiences despite similar exigences and constraints. 
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;To examine the texts, I’ll focus on the most apparent qualities of various TCG card packs, or the parts that a consumer will see first: colors, art, and text. Colors are the first piece of information a shopper will receive, and they primarily create an aesthetic, rather than present any information to the viewer. The art present on a pack can intrigue new customers, further drawing them in, or communicate to enfranchised buyers by using familiar imagery. Text, which is likely to be absorbed last, can both communicate practical information, like the contents and brand, and express a certain aesthetic, through both naming and font.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The packs in question will be those of the most recent sets of the three largest trading card games: Magic: The Gathering’s “Bloomburrow”, Pokémon’s “Stellar Crown”, and Yu-Gi-Oh’s “The Infinite Forbidden”. These three sets show the results of decades of refinements for each of these three games, which have all found great success in appealing to their intended audiences.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In order to determine how the colors, art, and text of each pack separates them from one another, I’ll examine how each quality appeals to both those who have previously bought product for a game, and to those who haven’t interacted with the IP before. Additionally, I’ll further analyze the art by splitting it into two sub-categories: its style, and its subject.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I’ll begin by summarizing the appearance of each pack, starting with those of Bloomburrow, the most recent premier set for Magic. Bloomburrow is a transparent attempt to appeal to consumers’ love of animals and generally cute settings. Its boosters make this very clear via aesthetic, showing a watercolor-esque image of a robed, bipedal mouse wielding a sword and shield while standing on a grass field in front of a calm, sky-blue background. Stellar Crown, Pokémon’s latest set in its Scarlet and Violet series, takes a radically different approach. Its booster packs (which can have one of four images) all feature a brightly colored, crystallized Pokémon in a dynamic pose over a high-contrast background with a ‘halo’ made of rainbow-colored gems over its head that obscures part of the pack’s text. Yu-Gi-Oh!’s The Infinite Forbidden lies in a muddy middle-ground between these two, featuring a titanic figure with light being emitted from between its hands over a somewhat muted background.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The colors of each pack are likely the most apparent difference between them. Bloomburrow picks soft colors, with a warm foreground over a cooler background providing a sense of safety and calm. Stellar Crown, on all of its pack designs, makes liberal use of bright and saturated tones, making it feel action-packed and dynamic. The Infinite Forbidden, in all honesty, is fairly dull color wise. Like Bloomburrow, its foreground has a stark contrast with its background due to choices in hue, but other than the light in the center of the image, not much appears notable about the choices in color. The general dullness of the image almost seems like it could be unattractive to potential new buyers. Bloomburrow’s color choices appeal to those less interested in excessive excitement, while Stellar Crown’s intensity seems designed to entice children, with its colors easily drawing attention to itself.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The art of each pack, as previously stated, is two-fold. The general style used tends to support the aesthetic decisions established by color schemes. Bloomburrow’s watercolor-like adds to its tranquility, Stellar Crown’s three-dimensional, “in your face” graphics enhance its intensity, and The Infinite Forbidden’s classic, flat art appeals to enfranchised players who have a history with the game. The actual image depicted tends to mean two different things, depending on how aware the audience is of the game’s storyline and brand. The mouse on Bloomburrow’s packaging, known as Mabel to those who have read the story, acts as a protagonist for the set’s tie-in story, and thus as a face for the set as a whole. For a consumer unaware of this, the mouse is a representation of the setting, balancing the whimsy of a woodland creature with weapons that express the presence of a conflict. Due to Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh’s TCGs being relatively undriven by stories, with most stories occurring in other, disconnected mediums, Stellar Crown and The Infinite Forbidden are missing this quality to their art. Instead, their arts show figures that are symbolic of the set as a whole. Stellar Crown’s packs show various Pokémon that use the new Stellar Tera mechanic. For players interested in gameplay, these provide a glimpse into the set, and build interest for how the mechanic plays during actual games. For collectors, the arts are bright and intriguing. The Infinite Forbidden doesn’t offer much for those unfamiliar with Yu-Gi-Oh, but depicts Exodia, a long-iconic figure in the franchise. In this way, the set continues to further appeal to experienced players in particular.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The text on each pack is relatively minimal, allowing the art to do most of the heavy lifting. Bloomburrow is very minimalistic in this aspect, showing the game, set, and booster type with no real affair, apart from the set name’s styling. The text appears in a woodsy and fantastical font in white over the grass below the mouse’s feet, with a green glow emanating from the lettering. The combination of the font used and the name helps to reinforce the whimsy previously mentioned that acts as the core of the set’s marketing. Stellar Crown features the brightly colored Pokémon logo above the set’s logo, which uses a hexagonal font with a rainbow sheen in order to call attention to the Stellar mechanic the set introduces. Uniquely, the art for these boosters is allowed to obscure part of the brand’s text, which allows for it to “pop” more. The Infinite Forbidden features the most branding text, showing the Konami and Yu-Gi-Oh logos in fairly large fonts, while using a fairly generic but thin font to allow the set’s name to fit on the packaging easily. These choices continue to not provide much of a ground for new buyers to find interest in, strengthening the idea that the focus of the packaging is on maintaining existing players, rather than obtaining new ones.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;For the three examined products, it’s fairly clear what the motivation of each publisher is, and what kind of audience they attempt to appeal to. Magic’s focus is fairly broad, being “people who enjoy animals and peace”, but when compared to that of Pokémon, it’s clear that it’s intended for a more mature audience. This isn’t because of the presence of child-unfriendly content, but more because of the lack of child-specific content. Pokémon, however, makes its intent for a young audience very clear with its brightly-colored and radiant packaging. Yu-Gi-Oh doesn’t really appeal to an age range or demographic, rather appealing more to those who already know of and play the game.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;For consumers, knowing the intent of the product one is buying is highly important. While the categories above are nowhere near strict, with each game intending to reach consumers of all forms, they show generally what the aim of the content is, and how likely the actual cards within the packs and each game as a whole are to appeal to a specific group. On a more personal note, while the motivations discussed in this essay don’t provide a definitive answer for what exactly pulled me into TCGs, they do give an idea of the kind of aspects that may have appealed to the parent of a young child. Pokémon, as a property, is highly child-focused, and the card game is no exception.
