        <h1>A Letter to the Professor</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Dear Professor,
	        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t have very high expectations when I signed up for this class. Yes, a college class would probably be more rigorous than my high school English classes, but that wasn’t a very high bar to cross. English I and II, despite being honors classes, taught me nothing new, and AP Language, despite supposedly being “college level”, only gave me a few new vocabulary words to toss around. The brunt of all three of these classes was churning out summaries, essays, and short analyses of various texts, and there wasn’t very much that required any intense thinking or soul-searching. The classes were full of chores upon chores, completion grades whose only purpose seemed to be to weigh down my already heavy workload.
	        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I won’t lie and say this course was life-changing, but it did feel much less like a chore than previous English classes. It’s likely a mix of the college format, which is much less hands-on than high school classes are, the untimed assignments whose due dates are set at the beginning of the semester, and the lack of face-to-face classes or lectures (which, in other classes,  were usually just excuses to give more assignments). The assignments being fairly free-form, usually leaving up their length and depth to the student, was much more enjoyable than the excessive word counts I’ve become used to since starting high school. And when we did have mandated length requirements, I often found myself achieving them without thinking, rather than having to pad my essays with endless filler.
	        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;When writing for this course, I felt more like I was speaking than I had when writing otherwise. The prompts were usually fairly open-ended, which left room for me to write about topics I was genuinely interested in, rather than whatever text the curriculum dictated we read next. That’s not to say that everything we looked at was riveting, but it usually was meant to facilitate our writing skills, or to teach us a new concept that we would later be able to base a more interesting assignment on. Out of the three major projects, I would say that the second was the best example of this. The text we read dealt with writing habits, and despite it being a fairly uninteresting study, it contained details that would lead to me picking a topic I had personal stake in (my experiences with procrastination) and expanding it into what felt like a fairly clean essay.
	        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I’d like to thank you for the feedback you provided on the major projects. It’s much more in-depth than the feedback I’ve received from other teachers, and even though you’re teaching such a large class, it manages to feel like time and care was put into it.
